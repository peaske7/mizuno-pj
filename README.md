# Temporary repo for mizuno-pj

- adelaida ... preprocessor of the preprocessor. converts input (pdfs) into workable images. Also may have an API that interfaces with a frontend client.
Image processing should NOT be handled by adelaida, and instead, should be handled by fyodor. adelaida must handle everything before that.

- fyodor ... cleans the images and extracts text
